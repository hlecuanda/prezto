Prezto â€” Instantly Awesome Zsh
==============================

Prezto is the configuration framework for [Zsh][1]; it enriches the command
line interface environment with sane defaults, aliases, functions, auto
completion, and prompt themes.

This is a development fork, where I triage PRs, bugfixes and contributions or
work on my own new stuff for Prezto, if you want to install prezto, or if you
are looking for the [official repo](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto),
you may find it [here](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)

The code in some of the branches here is a work in progress, experimental
incomplete, insecure, embarrasing, not representative of my work,  inelegant,
contains spelling errors, may be slow, unoptimized, or poorly designed; lacks
tests, and if it doesen't lack tests, it probably fails most of them
misserably; may contain rude remarks and expletives, may not even compile, it
should be considered toxic, a terrible example of best practices, mediocre
example of worst practices and will surely cause data loss, corruption,
incontrollable urges to swear inappropriately and cause kittens to die in
horrible pain if executed. Really, get the [official version](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)
