Prezto — Instantly Awesome Zsh
==============================

Prezto is the configuration framework for [Zsh][1]; it enriches the command
line interface environment with sane defaults, aliases, functions, auto
completion, and prompt themes.

This is a development fork, where I triage PRs, bugfixes and contributions or
work on my own new stuff for Prezto, if you want to install prezto, or if you
are looking for the [official repo](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto),
you may find it [here](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)

The code in this repo is mostly the work of the Prezto Team.

However, branches local to this repository, specially code authored by me,
should be considered a work in (perpetual) progress, experimental incomplete,
insecure, embarrasing, not representative of my work,  inelegant, contains
spelling errors, may be slow, unoptimized, or poorly designed; lacks tests,
and if it doesen't lack tests, it probably fails most of them misserably; may
contain rude remarks and expletives, may not even compile, it should be
considered toxic, a terrible example of best practices, mediocre example of
worst practices and will surely cause data loss, corruption, incontrollable
urges to swear inappropriately and cause kittens to die in horrible pain if
executed. 

**Really, get the [official version](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)**

Stuff I've submitted to _prezto_
----------------------------------------

- **Runcoms documentation** I wrote an explanation about [how _prezto_ ties in
  to zsh’s startup](https://github.com/hlecuanda/prezto/blob/5d2b2a776e3ae1145c25d147869371c3ddf1b274/runcoms/README.md) it turned out to be too long because i got carried away so
  I came up with a [shorter version](https://github.com/hlecuanda/prezto/blob/5ec8ce51751673bbb4e3f1c1d84858ea48fd21e5/runcoms/README.md)
